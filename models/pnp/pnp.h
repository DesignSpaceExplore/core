/// This model contains the plug and play functionality of the GRLIB AHB Master.
/// It provides the registers to the AHB Bus. And gathers its content from the instantiated model in the simulation environment.
///
/// See the GRLIB userâ€™s manual for more information.
/// These reegister are combined into an array which is connected to the AHB controller unit.
/// The plug&play information is mapped on a read-only address area, defined by the cfgaddr and cfgmask
/// VHDL generics, in combination with the ioaddr and iomask VHDL generics. By default, the
/// area is mapped on address 0xFFFFF000 - 0xFFFFFFFF. The master information is placed on the first
/// 2 kbyte of the block (0xFFFFF000 - 0xFFFFF800), while the slave information is placed on the second
/// 2 kbyte block. Each unit occupies 32 bytes, which means that the area has place for 64 masters
/// and 64 slaves. The address of the plug&play information for a certain unit is defined by its bus index.
/// The address for masters is thus 0xFFFFF000 + n*32, and 0xFFFFF800 + n*32 for slaves.
///
/// In oder to use this implementation you have to know that ther is no mechanism to unregister devices
/// , once a device is registered it connected. Furthermore there is no logic to handle the deletion of
/// a device.

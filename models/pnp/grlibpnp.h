/// This model contains the plug and play functionality of the GRLIB AHB Master. 
/// It provides the registers to the AHB Bus. And gathers its content from the instantiated model in the simulation environment.
///
/// See the GRLIB userâ€™s manual for more information. 
/// These reegister are combined into an array which is connected to the AHB controller unit.
/// The plug&play information is mapped on a read-only address area, defined by the cfgaddr and cfgmask
/// VHDL generics, in combination with the ioaddr and iomask VHDL generics. By default, the
/// area is mapped on address 0xFFFFF000 - 0xFFFFFFFF. The master information is placed on the first
/// 2 kbyte of the block (0xFFFFF000 - 0xFFFFF800), while the slave information is placed on the second
/// 2 kbyte block. Each unit occupies 32 bytes, which means that the area has place for 64 masters
/// and 64 slaves. The address of the plug&play information for a certain unit is defined by its bus index.
/// The address for masters is thus 0xFFFFF000 + n*32, and 0xFFFFF800 + n*32 for slaves.
///
/// In oder to use this implementation you have to know that ther is no mechanism to unregister devices
/// , once a device is registered it connected. Furthermore there is no logic to handle the deletion of
/// a device.
///
/// @param ioaddr   The MSB address of the I/O area. Sets the 12 most significant bits in the 
///                 32-bit AHB address (i.e. 31 downto 20). Allowed values are between 0 and 16#FFF#. 
///                 Default value is 16#FFF#.
/// @param iomask   The I/O area address mask. Sets the size of the I/O area and the start 
///                 address together with ioaddr. Allowed values are between 0 and 16#FFF#. 
///                 Default value is 16#FFF#.
/// @param cfgaddr  The MSB address of the configuration area. Sets 12 bits in the 32-bit AHB 
///                 address (i.e. 19 downto 8). Allowed are values from 0 to 16#FFF#. 
///                 Default value is 16#FF0#.
/// @param cfgmask  The address mask of the configuration area. Sets the size of the configuration 
///                 area and the start address together with cfgaddr. If set to 0, the configuration 
///                 will be disabled. Values between 0 and 16#FFF# are allowed, default is 16#FF0#.

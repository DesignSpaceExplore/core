= This Folder contains the TLM Module of the GPTimer =
== TLM Model ==
 gptimer.h                   - The GPTimer TLM Header
 gptimer.cpp                 - The GPTimer TLM Implementation
 gpcounter.h                 - Counter Class Header (A counter instance inside the Timer)
 gpcounter.cpp               - Counter Class Implementation

== RTL Wrapper ==
 tests/gptimer_warpper.vhd   - For RTL Model co-simulation purpose: 
                               A wrapter for the GRLIB Model of the GPTimer
 tests/gptimer_adapter.h     - Contains an adapter to connect the GRLIB GPTimer RTL Model to the LT testbenches

== Tests ==
 tests/test1                 - Register access test
 tests/test2                 - Prescaler and Counter test
 tests/test3                 - Dhalt and chaning test

== Test Structure ==
Every testcase will contain the following files:
 testbench.h                 - The test definition
 testbench.cpp               - The test implementation
 top_tlm.cpp                 - Top-level class and parametrisation for a test with tlm model tested
 top_ctb.cpp                 - Top-level class and parametrisation for a test with tlm model but ct busses
                               This is needed to compare timing of the tlm model with the rtl model
 top_rtl.cpp                 - Top-level class and parametrisation for a test with rtl model

== Others ==
wscript                      - Build instructions for waf
README                       - This file

= How to build =
The best way to build and execute everything is to use the top-level waf build system:
>>> ./waf configure
>>> ./waf

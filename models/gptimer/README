= This Folder contains the TLM Module of the GPTimer =

gptimer.h          - The GPTimer TLM Header
gptimer.tpp        - The GPTimer TLM Implementation (Template include)

gptimer-rec.patch  - A patch to make GRLIB records working with Modlsim scgenmod
APB_CT_RTL.h       - An adapter to connect an GRLIB APB Device to the AMBAKit APB Bus

testbench.h        - A generic LT Testbench to stimulate RTL and TLM Models
top_LT.cpp         - The Top-Level-File for the TLM Model Test
top_CT.cpp         - The Top-Level-File for the RTL Model Test
modelsim.ini       - Modelsim configuration for the GRLIB
test.sh            - A script to automate a serie of Tests

Makefile           - A simple Makefile to build both Testcases (TLM & RTL)

waf                - Waf 1.6.4
wscript            - A Waf configuration to build the TLM Model Test, but not the RTL Model Test for now
find.py            - Some Helperfunctions, might disapear or go into waf

For the AMBAKit you need to have the "extensionPool.h" file out of TLM Examples in your path.

== How to build ==
The best way to build the TLM Test is to use waf:

./waf configure
./waf

To build the RTL Test you need to set your environment right with Modelsim. Have a look into the Makefile

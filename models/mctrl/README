This directory contains a transaction level model of the Gaisler GRIP MCTRL memory controller and a generic memory model that implements all types of memory supported by MCTRL. The model constists of the following files:

mctrl_reg.h
defines the MCTRL register addresses and write masks

mctrl.h
defines the MCTRL model as a template class

mctrl.tpp
implements the MCTRL model

generic_memory.h
defines the memory model as a template class

generic_memory.tpp
implements the memory model

mctrl_tb.h
defines a testbench for the MCTRL model as a template class

mctrl_tb.tpp
implements the testbench

mctrl_testtop_tlm.cpp
implements the top-level of a simulation of the MCTRL model. Instances of the testbench, MCTRL, and the memory model are built and connected.

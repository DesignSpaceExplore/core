= This directory contains a TLM of the Gaisler GRIP IRQMP interrupt controller =
== TLM Model ==
 irqmp.h                     - The IRQMP TLM Header
 irqmp.cpp                   - The IRQMP TLM Implementation

== RTL Wrapper ==
 tests/irqmp_wrapper.vhd     - For RTL Model co-simulation purpose: 
                               A wrapter for the GRLIB Model of the IRQMP
 tests/irqmp_adapter.h       - Contains an adapter to connect the GRLIB IRQMP RTL Model to the LT testbenches

== Tests ==
 tests/test1                 - Pending registers and masking test
 tests/test2                 - Broadcasting irqs and force registers test
 tests/test3                 - Deactivated eirq settings test

== Test Structure ==
Every testcase will contain the following files:
 testbench.h                 - The test definition
 testbench.cpp               - The test implementation
 top_tlm.cpp                 - Top-level class and parametrisation for a test with tlm model tested
 top_ctb.cpp                 - Top-level class and parametrisation for a test with tlm model but ct busses
                               This is needed to compare timing of the tlm model with the rtl model
 top_rtl.cpp                 - Top-level class and parametrisation for a test with rtl model
  
== Others ==
wscript                      - Build instructions for waf
README                       - This file

= How to build =
The best way to build and execute everything is to use the top-level waf build system:
>>> ./waf configure
>>> ./waf
